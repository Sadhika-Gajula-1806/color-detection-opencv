##  Efficient Real-Time Object Color Detection using OpenCV 

This Python project captures webcam video and efficiently detects multiple colors (like Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, etc.) in real-time using the HSV color space. It also uses a Haar Cascade Classifier to detect and mask human faces to avoid false color detection on skin tones.

---

##  Features

- Real-time webcam video processing using OpenCV
- HSV color space for accurate color filtering
- Face masking using Haar cascades
- Detects and labels Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Orange, Purple, Pink, Brown, White, and Black
- Press `q` to quit the video stream

### Real-Time Color Detection App

Frustrated with inconsistent color matching in your projects? This Python application helps you detect and identify colors from webcam feed using OpenCV.

- The app detects multiple colors in real time.
- Faces are masked using Haar cascades to avoid false color detection on skin tones.
- Bounding rectangles with color labels highlight detected colors.
- Press `q` to quit.
